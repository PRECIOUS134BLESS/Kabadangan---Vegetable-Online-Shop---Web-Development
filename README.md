KABADANGAN is designed to help farmers thrive by connecting them directly with consumers, cutting out middlemen who often inflate prices and take a big share of the profits. 
With our website, farmers can set their own prices and earn more for their hard work. 
KABADANGAN also offers tools to monitor the quantity of harvested and cultivated vegetables, providing real-time data on production levels.
This helps farmers make smart decisions about what to grow and how much, preventing oversupply and reducing the risk of selling at a loss.
By streamlining their business and aligning production with demand, farmers can enjoy better profits, and consumers get fresh, locally grown veggies at great prices.
